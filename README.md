يوجدت نسختين من EAC: الأولى مدفوعة وتسمى EAC، والأخرى مجانية وتسمى EOC وهي الأكثر شيوعًا في معظم الألعاب. لقد قمت برفع SDK لمساعدتك في فهم كيفية عمل EAC. على كل حال، يعتبر EOC أضعف من النسخة المدفوعة بحكم أنه مجاني، ولكن هذا لا يمنع المطورين من شراء ميزات إضافية. ما أريد تسليط الضوء عليه هنا هو أنه إذا لم يتم تثبيت EOC أو تعريفه بشكل جيد في اللعبة، فمن السهل تجاوزه.

### ENGLISH
**Found two versions of EAC:** the first one is paid and called EAC, and the other one is free and called EOC, which is the most common in most games. I uploaded the SDK to help you understand how EAC works. In any case, EOC is considered weaker than the paid version because it's free, but that doesn't prevent developers from purchasing additional features. What I want to highlight here is that if EOC is not installed or defined properly in the game, it's easy to bypass it.
